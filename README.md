<h1>Simple Investment Calculator</h1>
Date: 2018

<h2>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?</h2>
<p> I was tasked with creating a investment calculator that would take the user's input (Initial Investment Amount / Monthly Deposit / Annual Interest Rate / Number of Years) and provide 2 yearly summary statements. The first yearly statement would provide interest accured with no monthly deposit and closing amount over each year. The second statement provided would provide interest accured with a monthly deposit and closing amount over each year. The program is flexible and allows the user to adjust their input.</p>

<h2> What did you do particularly well?</h2>
<p>Planning. I spent a decent amount of time working on a flowchart in order to understand all the components that would need to be built. I was able to build small and test often resulting in a better end product.</p>

<h2>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?</h2>
<p> Adding an option for the end user to determine what type of statement they would like to see. During testing I had built out a chart that would provide monthly statements. An option to see Yearly OR Monthly statements would be a nice enhancement. Revamping the structure a bit to include a way for a user to change their data inputs without having to enter them all again would be a nice add.</p>

<h2>Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?</h2>
<p>This was the first project that utlized objects and how to get/ set private variables. I found our textbook super helpful to break this down. My other resources included Stack Overflow, Discord Programming community and colleagues(code review) </p>

<h2>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?</h2>
<p>My knowledge of Objects, functions and organizing file structure.</p>

<h2>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h2>
<p>Building small, testing frequently and made sure to comment on all pieces of my code in order to make it maintainable/readable. I also made a separate file to contain my classes so they are adaptable and transferable. The data input and calculations were separated out into their own files to make it more adaptable for future add ons.</p>
